The Student Grading System is a Python-based application designed to manage and evaluate student performance. This system allows for the entry of student information, including their name, surname, school number, and exam scores. It then determines whether each student has passed or failed the course based on predefined grade ranges.

Using this system, the following steps are involved in grading students:

Data Input:

The user can input student information such as name, surname, school number, and exam scores.
Grade Range:

A predefined grade range is established to assign letter grades to students based on their exam scores. For example:
100-80: A
79-70: B
69-60: C
59-50: D
Below 50: F
Pass/Fail Determination:

Based on the entered exam score, the system determines whether each student has passed or failed the course according to the grade range.
Student Evaluation:

The system evaluates each student's exam score and assigns a letter grade (e.g., A, B, C) based on the grade range.
Result Presentation:

The system displays whether each student has passed or failed the course based on their exam scores. If a student has passed, the system indicates "Passed," and if they have failed, it shows "Failed."
Data Management:

The system maintains a record of student information, including their name, surname, school number, exam scores, and pass/fail status.
Data Analysis:

The system generates a dataframe that provides an overview of the students' performance, including their grades and pass/fail status.
Export to Excel:

The generated dataframe can be exported to an Excel file for easy storage, sharing, and further analysis.
By utilizing this Student Grading System, educators and administrators can efficiently manage student information, evaluate performance, and determine the pass/fail status of students in various courses.
